      "that would be the last football game that Dean and I would attend together",
    storySummary: `Dean was the life of the party. In fact, we as a family agreed that when Dean was born, he took all the swag out of the gene pool.
             His swag was so strong that the Carolina Panthers sent the two of us to Super Bowl 52. Little did I realize, that would be the 
             last football game that Dean and I would attend together. 
             
             Dean was born with Downs Syndrome and was one of best guys I’ve ever known. When the Panthers became an NFL team, he and 
             I immediately latched on, creating one of the strongest bonds we would share throughout his life. In addition to our 
             extreme fandom, Dean was heavily involved in helping build the Special Olympics flag football league sponsored by the Panthers. 
             For his contributions with that and for being a super fan, the Panthers sent Dean to Super Bowl 52 (and I got to ride his coattails). 
             It was a trip of a lifetime. We cheered, danced, and mercilessly heckled fans from rival teams. 
             
             In preparation for the 2018 season, Dean began hinting (or outright saying) that he wanted me to take him to a game. 
             Shortly after the daily calls and voicemails on that subject began, Dean got sick, ended up in the ICU and would go on to 
             pass in late August. In his honor, we still attended a game, got rowdier than ever, and watched the Panthers obliterate the 
             Ravens. It had Dean’s hand all over it. These shoes will always help me remember my brother in one of the only ways he’d want 
             to be remembered - with his own shoe containing the story of the Carolina Panthers.`,

    storySummary: `I’ve always had a passion for youth and knew at a young age that being in the youth ministry was where I wanted to end up. 
        As I was coming into my 20s, I began youth ministry through a couple stops in New Mexico and Texas. After several years out west, 
        I heard a service by Elevation church and knew that’s where I needed to be. My family and I moved to Charlotte, NC without knowing anyone.
        
        After a few weeks of attending Elevation, I was prompted to apply for an apprenticeship there. I did so and ended up spending the 
        next six months working at Elevation Church as a member of the 2K2 program. Following 2K2, I was hired on staff and spent a couple years 
        moving in and out of youth roles at one of the campuses. During this time, I felt like God gave me a vision for what youth ministry at 
        Elevation would be. Shortly there after, I was placed as the head of the youth ministry...for two short weeks. I ended up being replaced 
        due to experience concerns and spent the next two years back at the campus and then building our online youth platform.
        
        Fast forward to YTHX 19. I would have the opportunity to preach on the main stage to thousands of youth and afterwards, 
        would once again be made the head of the youth ministry. These shoes mark, almost to the day, the turning point towards what 
        God had for me at Elevation Church.`,

        I drew for fun, to escape, and to just process life.
        
        John Lassiter, one of the founders of Pixar, was a close family friend when we lived in California and, 
        after navigating his outrageous calendar, I was once able to sit down and show him my portfolio. He loved it and wrote a letter of 
        recommendation to Cal Arts with a promise to me that I’d have a job at Pixar upon completion. To make a long story short, financing 
        fell through and I wasn’t able to attend, therefore forfeiting the job offer thereafter. I was crushed and thought I’d missed my only 
        opportunity to draw for a living.
        
        After several years of moving around and working jobs at all ends of the spectrum, I ended up attending Elevation church. 
        I spoke to the creative director to see about a volunteering opportunity and walked out with a job. It’s been almost 8 years 
        since and I’m still in awe that through the ins and outs, drawing is what I get to do with my life.`,

        former high school teachers that provides week long retreats for breast cancer patients and families. 
        
        When given the chance to attend a local “Dancing with the Stars” event put on by Little Pink Houses of Hope, he saw an 
        opportunity to support a long time friend and participant in the competition as well as pay tribute to Ganny and Booya 
        through custom shoes.

        for many years to come. It has spoken to the heart of my household already this year on a number of levels. 
        
        In the midst of one of the strongest bridges known to worship music resides the line “you turn bones into armies”. As 
        we sang this song at church while ringing in the new year, I was struck by how much this year was going to be a bones 
        into armies year - that God was going to take lost hopes, dreams, and promises and bring them to fruition before our 
        very eyes. Thus the idea for these shoes was born. 
        
        The word my family is rallying around this year is “restoration” - a true bones into armies term. Steven Furtick, 
        Chris Brown, Tiffany Hammer, and Brandon Lake delivered a poignant and timely reminder for what this year will hold 
        and now these shoes will carry the visual representation of the melody playing over and over in my head.`,

    storySummary: `These are an homage to a time when weather is cooler, lights are brighter, and Christmas spirit permeates 
        the air like the cinnamon scent in a Christmas specialty shop. The specific event is the annual Elevation Church staff 
        party, The Ellys. 
        
        While, like every year, the 2019 Ellys were a unique mix of ridiculousness, a Comedy Central roast, and an end of year 
        celebration, this particular year ushered us into the real life world of Candyland. The Ellys dictates the most formal of 
        attire be donned, but I felt that it was appropriate to offset the formal with some fun - as the night itself would do. 
        It is always the most anticipated event of the year within Elevation Church staff culture and it only felt appropriate 
        that I celebrate it in my own unique way - with a story of candy, Christmas, and culture on my feet.`,

    storySummary: `I’ve always been fascinated by illusionary art. Brain teasers, optical illusions, and even those crazy 3D picture 
        books could keep me entertained for hours as a kid. Growing up, MC Escher was my favorite artist because he would create art 
        that defied the laws of physics and make you have to really pay attention to understand what was going on.
        
        One random afternoon, I found my way to the local Salvation Army and picked up a beat pair of black Air Force 1 lows. 
        When making the all important decision of what art should grace the forces, I immediately went back to my childhood and 
        the illusionary art I so loved. While staring at the Nike swoosh, I realized there existed a unique opportunity. 
        If I could figure out how to do it, the Penrose triangle (or impossible triangle) could be made up of Nike swooshes. 
        I went back and forth for hours, but finally landed on a final possibility and decided it was the one. I proceeded to 
        choose bright colors to stand out from the black and created my own piece of illusionary art.
        
        Every time I see these shoes, I’m reminded of just how fun it was (and is) to lose yourself in a piece of art that 
        defies physics and makes your mind fill with wonder.`,

    storySummary: `Family time is the best time. The ability to carry those memories with you, though, is priceless. 
        
        Every year, Tinley gets to spend a week with all her cousins at the beach and it’s one of her favorite weeks of the year. 
        As a young appreciator of art, “The Great Wave Off Kanagawa” by Japanese artist Hokusai reminds her of all those moments shared by the 
        family. For her, having pieces of that print on a pair of shoes was a way she could carry those memories with her well beyond that single 
        week at the beach.`,
